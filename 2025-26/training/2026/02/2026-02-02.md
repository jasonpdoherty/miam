# Training Session - Monday 2nd February 2026

**Duration:** 60 mins

---

## WARM UP LAPS (5 mins)
2-3 laps, increasing pace each lap. Light dynamic stretches on the move.

**Coaching notes:** Get them moving immediately. Call out high knees, heel flicks, side shuffles on the straights to loosen up.

## PYRAMID RELAY SPRINTS (12 mins)
Players pair up. Pyramid format - each pair alternates sprints: 1 each, then 2 each, then 3 each, then 4 each. First pair back wins each round.

**Setup:** Parallel lanes (~25m). Cone at the far end, cone at the start for each pair.

**How it works:** First person sprints to far cone, picks it up, brings it back. Second person takes it back and puts it down. Alternate. Cone must be placed, not thrown. No handover until cone is down.

**Coaching notes:** Builds intensity progressively - by the time they're on 4 sprints each they're working hard. The pickup/putdown stops any corner cutting and forces them to get low.

**Part 2 - With ball:** Same pyramid format, but now dribbling. Must go around the far cone and back. Ball must be under control at handover - no wild passes. Emphasise close control at speed, not just booting it and chasing.

## POSSESSION - GATE GAME (12 mins)
Two teams in one square. Red cone gate at one end, blue cone gate at the other. When you shout a colour, both teams try to get the ball through that gate.

**Setup:** ~20x15m area. One colour gate at each end (2 cones, ~3m wide).

**Coaching notes:** Keeps them thinking - can't just settle into attacking one way. Quick transitions when you switch the colour. Encourage sharp passing and movement off the ball. Call colours unpredictably to keep them honest.

## SHOOTING DRILL (12 mins)
Two lines feeding a striker. Quick combinations - wall pass or give-and-go - then shot. Rotate shooter/feeder.

**Setup:** One line at edge of box with balls, one line central (strikers). Feeder plays into striker, striker lays off, feeder returns it, striker shoots.

**Coaching notes:** Emphasise first touch out of feet, head up before shooting, and hitting the target. No snatching at shots. Add a passive defender after a few rounds to increase pressure. Keep the queue moving - no standing around.

---

## CORNERS (15 mins if time)
Practise set piece delivery and attacking runs. Rotate takers. Work on near post, far post, and edge of box options.

**Coaching notes:** Focus on timing of runs and quality of delivery. Defenders can be added once the attacking patterns are clicking. Keep it game-realistic - no standing around waiting for the perfect ball.
