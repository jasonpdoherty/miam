# ⚽ SESSION 2 - BUILDING THE COMPETITIVE EDGE

**60 minutes | Fitness Focus with Competitive Intensity**

---

## 1. WARM-UP (6 min)
- 2 laps of the pitch
- **Progression:** Second lap at 70% intensity to prime them for what's coming
- Dynamic stretching while moving (high knees, butt kicks, side steps)

---

## 2. LADDER SHUTTLE HELL 2.0 (18 min)

**Setup:** START ——10m—— A ——20m—— B ——30m—— C ——40m—— D

**THE LADDER:** 10→20→30→40→30→20→10 (7 segments)
**Format:** 45s work, 30s recovery × 10 rounds
**⚠️ PICK UP CONES ON THE WAY OUT, PUT THEM DOWN ON THE WAY BACK!**

**COMPETITIVE TWIST:**
- **Round 1-3:** Individual times - announce fastest/slowest
- **Round 4-6:** Partner challenge - work in pairs, combined time matters
- **Round 7-10:** Team battle - split into 2 groups, losing team does bonus round

**Why this progression:** Last session they conquered 12 rounds of basic shuttles. Time to step up the distance and add team competition!

## 3. DIAMOND PRESSURE COOKER (15 min)

```
      A
     / \
    /   \
   /  P  \    (P = Pressure player in center)
  /   1   \   (12m diamond sides)
 D---------B
      \   /
       \ /
        C
```

**Setup:** 4 players on diamond corners, 1 pressure player center
**Rules:** 
- **2-touch only** (step up from last session's triangles)
- Pressure player tries to intercept or force bad pass
- If intercepted: interceptor joins diamond, bad passer becomes pressure
- **TARGET:** 15 consecutive passes without interception

**COMPETITIVE ELEMENT:**
- Time how long each group takes to reach 15 passes
- Losing group does 30-second plank hold
- Multiple diamonds competing simultaneously

## 4. CROSS & FINISH SHOOTING (15 min)

```
      [GOAL]
    |    GK    |
    |          |
    |    ×××   |  (3 attackers)
    |          |
    +----------+
         ↑
    W (wide player)
```

**Setup:**
- Wide player on touchline with balls
- 3 attackers in penalty area
- Goalkeeper in goal

**How it works:**
1. Wide player drives low cross across goal
2. 3 attackers attack near post, center, far post
3. First touch finish only - no taking extra touches
4. Rotate: Scorer becomes wide player, wide player joins queue, new player enters

**COMPETITIVE SCORING:**
- **Near post finish:** 1 point
- **Center finish:** 2 points  
- **Far post finish:** 3 points
- **First team to 20 points wins** - losers do 10 burpees

---

## 5. TRANSITION GAME (6 min)

**Setup:** 30m × 20m area, 6v6 + 2 goalkeepers
**Rules:**
- Normal game BUT when you lose possession, your team must receive the ball in your own half before you can attack again
- Forces teams to transition properly through the phases  
- Emphasizes quick ball movement and positional discipline under pressure

---

## POST-SESSION REVIEW NOTES

**Key progression from last session:**
- ✅ Increased shuttle complexity (ladder vs straight)
- ✅ Reduced touches in passing (2-touch vs 3-touch)
- ✅ Added more competitive team elements
- ✅ New shooting setup to maintain engagement
- ✅ Game-situation fitness integration

**Watch for:**
- Can they maintain intensity through longer shuttle sequence?
- How do they handle 2-touch pressure in diamonds?
- Are they competing with each other or supporting?
- Fitness levels during transition game

**Next session ideas if this goes well:**
- Box shuttle patterns (4-way movement)
- 5v2 possession squares (even more pressure)
- Volleys and half-volleys shooting
- Condition games with fitness penalties

## COACH NOTES

**Pre-session team talk:**
*"Last week you smashed those shuttles and showed real character. Tonight we're stepping up - longer distances, quicker thinking, more competition. I want to see you push each other and raise the standard. Who's going to set the pace tonight?"*

**During session motivation:**
- Call out effort and competition, not just success
- Make the team battles matter - celebrate winners, challenge losers
- Keep energy high between drills - no standing around
- Use their names when they do something well

**If they're struggling:**
- Reduce ladder shuttle to 8 rounds instead of 10
- Allow 3-touch in diamonds if 2-touch is too much
- Extend recovery time between shuttle rounds to 45s

**If they're flying:**
- Add extra shuttle round for fastest group
- Go to 1-touch in diamonds for advanced groups  
- Add time pressure to shooting (must score within 10 seconds of cross)
- Make transition game 45s sprint penalty instead of goal line
